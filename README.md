 Data visualization using HSL traffic api 


The data of api doensn't seem particulary complicated or deep but it seems relatively wide with different kinds of data. The problem is that designing the frontend and the graphs for it is difficult without understanding the scope of the application.  This is why I think it's better to just fetch it and see how it looks like and get to know it better.  

As a frontend framework I'm using Astro with React. Astro is a modern framework that I want to learn more. It is also easy to set up, light weight and it is suitable for small projects like this.

I have been reading the documentation, set up the project and played around with the api. There are many things the api can do but for this project I going to focus on routes, disruption, cancelled trips and itinerary apis. Map, and real-time -apis would be interesting addition in the future.


Since I wanted to learn more about Astro and its ssr features I decided to do the api calls server side. This also keeps the api key in the server side. For this kind of data driven project ssr is also valid since I'm not planning to do much user interaction and state management.
